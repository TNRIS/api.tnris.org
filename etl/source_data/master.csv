Lidar data was collected for this project, encompassing four distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) within the State of Texas. These AOIs have been designated as AOI 1 through AOI 4. AOI1 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Rains, Wood, Upshur, Van Zandt, Smith, Gregg, Henderson and Cherokee. The AOI 2 is within Dallas County. AOI 3 covers portions of Ellis and Kaufman Counties. The remaining AOI 4 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Navarro, Henderson, Freestone and Anderson. The Lidar was calibrated and processed to produce digital elevation model (DEM), Lidar intensity image, classified LAS point cloud, and hydro-breakline files for the areas covered by the AOIs. The data is intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The products acquired by this contract are to be made available in the public domain through the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for use by government and the public. The project team includes Atkins North America, Inc., Williams Aerial and Mapping (WAM), and McKim; Creed. Fugro Geospatial Inc. conducted an independent QA/QC of the project deliverables for TNRIS. Project stakeholders include the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the City of Tyler (COT), the Trinity River Authority (TRA), and the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD).This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression.

Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.

The project AOI was defined by new quarter-quarter-quadrangle, NQQQ, tiles. The outside tiles were buffered by 300m on all sides and the interior tiles were buffered by 50m on all sides. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4pts /meter.Data was acquired by Terrapoint from May 20 through August 4th, 2010. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 375 aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS50-II MPiA sensor and a Cessna 210 aircraft, utilizing a Optech Sensor collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.

Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 310 twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Riegl LMS-Q680i Lidar sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The classified Lidar point cloud data are delivered in LAS 1.2 format: 1, unclassified, 2, bare-earth ground, 3, low vegetation, 4, medium vegetation, 5, high vegetation, 6, buildings, 7, low points(noise), 9, water, 13, bridges, and 14, culverts. Specialized in-house and commercial software processes the native Lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The horizontal datum for the data is UTM Coordinates, NAD83(2011) in meters and the vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) in meters using GEIOD12A.The data acquired will become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset.

In 1997, the legislature established a new water planning process, based on a “bottom-up,” consensus-driven approach. Coordinating this water planning process are 16 planning groups, one for each regional water planning area (see map). The planning groups, each made up of about 20 members, represent a variety of interests, including agriculture, industry, environment, public, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, groundwater management areas, and power generation. Each planning group approved bylaws to govern its methods of conducting business and designated a political subdivision, such as a river authority, groundwater conservation district, or council of governments, to administer the planning process and manage any contracts related to developing regional water plans. The planning groups conduct all functions during open meetings in an open and participatory manner. They hold special public meetings when they develop their scopes of work and hold hearings before adopting their regional water plans. This public involvement helps direct the planning and determine which water management strategies to recommend. Consensus building within the planning groups is crucial to ensure sufficient support for adopting the plan.

Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.

Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.

The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition are December 29, 2016-March 22, 2017. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.- Software with native LAZ support- ERDAS IMAGINE (14.1 and up) by Hexagon Geospatial- Global Mapper (13.1 and up) by Blue Marble Geo- ENVI LiDAR (5.1 and up) by Exelis VIS- FME (2012 and up) by Safe Software- LAStools by rapidlasso- plas.io 3D Web Viewer by Hobu Inc.- FUSION (3.40 and up) by Bob McGaughey of the USDA- Voyager (1.3 and up) by Voyager GIS- GRASS GIS (7.0 and up) by Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)", 2ft and 5ft Contours, T," Basemap, Research, Analysis", StratMap 2017 50cm East Texas Lidar,, https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/d/tnris-lidar/state/tx/tnris-lidar_tx.zip, images/data-catalog/entry/stratmap_2017_50cm_east_texas_lidar_overview.jpg, https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/datacatalog/supplemental_reports/stratmap_2017_50cm_east_texas_supplementalreports.zip,, T, Raster, https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/datacatalog/lidar_breaklines/stratmap_2017_50cm_east_texas_breaklines.zip," Delta County, Hopkins County, Hunt County, Rains County, San Jacinto County, Lidar, Point Cloud, LAS, Elevation, County, Historical",, Public Domain (Creative Commons CC0), 1/64 USGS Quadrangle,, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/, CC0,,, 2017,, None, Brazos County,," <p>Lidar data for Delta, Hopkins, Hunt, Rains, and San Jacinto Counties </p>", stratmap-2017-50cm-east-texas-lidar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This ""leaf-on"" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.", Compressed County Mosaics,, Basemap, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) 2008 CCM Orthoimagery,, https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/datacatalog/tile_index/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2008_ccm_tileindex.zip, images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2008_ccm_overview.jpg,,,, Raster,," Texas, Statewide, National Agricultural Imagery Program, NAIP, United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, Natural Color, NC, Infrared, CIR, Mosaic, Orthoimagery, Aerial, Historical", http://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/, Public Domain (Creative Commons CC0), County, United States Department of Agriculture, https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/, CC0," county,qquad",, 2008, T, 1m product replaced with TOP 2008, USDA,, <p>The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental United States.</p>, national-agriculture-imagery-program-naip-2008-ccm, images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2008_ccm_natural.jpg, images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2008_ccm_urban.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,
