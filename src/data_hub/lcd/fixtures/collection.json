      "description": "The project area is 802 DOQQQ tiles covering approximately 3241 square miles in the central region of Texas. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4 points per square meter. The dates of acquisition were from February 4, 2011 to March 5, 2011. A Leica ALS50 phase II+ and a Leica ALS60 Lidar sensor (Gonzales Block) were used collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.Lidar data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. Using a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning and inertial measurement technologies, Lidar instruments are able to make highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures and vegetation.The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

      "description": "The 6-inch orthoimagery Brazos County and the City of Palestine were flown during the 2015 leaf-off season in late January. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). Contributing partners were the Brazos Central Appraisal District, the City of Bryan, the City of College Station, the City of Palestine, Texas A&amp;M University, and the Texas Municipal Power Agency.The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers. Available image formats are compressed JPEG2000 or MrSID and uncompressed GeoTIFF. Flight date is in the image filename as YYYYMMDD. Orthoimagery datasets are valuable mapping assets benefitting natural resources, energy, environmental, emergency management, land use planning, economic development, and policy interests. The aerial imagery was acquired from aircraft with digital camera sensors and processed as highly accurate digital orthoimagery that are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base reference for other map information.",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data.The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape.

The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping (StratMap) Program of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The project area is approximately 1,136 square miles in Chambers, Jefferson, Liberty, and Orange County, Texas. The data was acquired by Sanborn with third party QAQC from AECOM. The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter in the Jefferson and Orange block and 8 points per square meter in the Chambers and Liberty block. The dates of acquisition are February 22,2017-March 23, 2017. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

      "description": "The purpose of this project is to support the ongoing data collection efforts by the State of Texas to facilitate the mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain. Lidar data was collected for this project, encompassing four distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) within the State of Texas. These AOIs have been designated as AOI 1 through AOI 4. AOI1 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Rains, Wood, Upshur, Van Zandt, Smith, Gregg, Henderson and Cherokee. The AOI 2 is within Dallas County. AOI 3 covers portions of Ellis and Kaufman Counties. The remaining AOI 4 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Navarro, Henderson, Freestone and Anderson. The Lidar was calibrated and processed to produce digital elevation model (DEM), Lidar intensity image, classified LAS point cloud, and hydro-breakline files for the areas covered by the AOIs. The data is intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The products acquired by this contract are to be made available in the public domain through the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for use by government and the public. The project team includes Atkins North America, Inc., Williams Aerial and Mapping (WAM), and McKim; Creed. Fugro Geospatial Inc. conducted an independent QA/QC of the project deliverables for TNRIS. Project stakeholders include the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the City of Tyler (COT), the Trinity River Authority (TRA), and the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD).This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.- Software with native LAZ support- ERDAS IMAGINE (14.1 and up) by Hexagon Geospatial- Global Mapper (13.1 and up) by Blue Marble Geo- ENVI LiDAR (5.1 and up) by Exelis VIS- FME (2012 and up) by Safe Software- LAStools by rapidlasso- plas.io 3D Web Viewer by Hobu Inc.- FUSION (3.40 and up) by Bob McGaughey of the USDA- Voyager (1.3 and up) by Voyager GIS- GRASS GIS (7.0 and up) by Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)",

All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by this rectangular system of surveys, which is regulated by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The PLSS typically divides land into 6-mile-square townships, which is the level of information included in the National Atlas. Townships are subdivided into 36 one-mile- square sections. Sections can be further subdivided into quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections, or irregular government lots.Normally, a permanent monument, or marker, is placed at each section corner. Monuments are also placed at quarter-section corners and at other important points, such as the corners of government lots. Today permanent monuments are usually inscribed tablets set on iron rods or in concrete.

Contributing partners were the Brazos Central Appraisal District, the City of Bryan, the City of College Station, Brazos 9-1-1, Texas A&amp;M University, and the Texas Municipal Power Agency.The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers. Available image formats are compressed JPEG2000 or ECW and uncompressed GeoTIFF. Flight date is in the image filename as YYYYMMDD. Orthoimagery datasets are valuable mapping assets benefitting natural resources, energy, environmental, emergency management, land use planning, economic development, and policy interests. The aerial imagery was acquired from aircraft with digital camera sensors and processed as highly accurate digital orthoimagery that are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base reference for other map information.",

      "description": "This data has been acquired and developed by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for collection and delivery of topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for the 918 sq. mile project area encompassing Fort Bend County, Texas. Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 104 flight lines in 9 lifts from February 12, 2014 to February 27, 2014. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 310 twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Riegl LMS-Q680i Lidar sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The classified Lidar point cloud data are delivered in LAS 1.2 format: 1, unclassified, 2, bare-earth ground, 3, low vegetation, 4, medium vegetation, 5, high vegetation, 6, buildings, 7, low points(noise), 9, water, 13, bridges, and 14, culverts. Specialized in-house and commercial software processes the native Lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The horizontal datum for the data is in NAD1983 State Plane TX South Central FIPS 4204 in Feet and the vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) in feet using GEIOD12A.The data acquired will become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The project consists of high accuracy classified Lidar data in LAS format as well as raster digital elevation models and intensity images.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

The Atlantic Group provided high accuracy, calibrated multiple return LiDAR for roughly 932 square miles within the Texas counties of Palo Pinto, Stephens, Hood, Johnson, Erath, Eastland, and Somervell.The nominal point spacing for this project was no less than 2 points per 1 square meter. RAMPP used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to project specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground, 11-Withheld Points. RAMPP produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 1270 tiles (1500 m x 1500 m) that cover the project area.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

      "description": "The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental United States. It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

The project area is approximately 286 square miles in Brazos County, Texas. The data was acquired by Dewberry with third party QAQC from Surveying and Mapping, LLC. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition are February 9-10, 2015. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

In addition, it has the advantage of being easily plotted on USGS topographic and other properly gridded maps by using a simple \"read right and then up\" convention where the user measures to the East and then North in linear increments. The coordinates are easily translated to distance as they are actually in meters rather than the more complex degree based increments of latitude and longitude.

Over 5,000 frames were scanned and referenced as part of the project using ERDAS Autosync. Seamless mosaics were also generated for each imagery dataset using ERDAS Mosaic Pro. This Imagery project was handled predominately by the TNRIS Internship program. This project created the opportunity for Interns to learn important and valuable skills relating to the GIS industry. In addition to professional practices, interns were trained in several industry software applications. This product afforded the interns the opportunity to produce an important dataset that is distributed to the public.Images were scanned at 800 dpi to create a 1 meter resolution dataset. ERDAS AutoSync was used to reference the historical imagery to the TOP 1995/1996 Orthoimagery dataset. The CIAP imagery is the most accurate historical imagery product that TNRIS has produced. The details on each frame’s accuracy and statistics are included in metadata for each frame.Mosaics were created in the Mosaic Pro toolset of ERDAS. The mosaics are black and white, 1 meter resolution datasets of each of the collections. Referenced images were edgematched prior to mosaicking to ensure a seamless product. The mosaics were color balanced, dodged, feathered and smoothed to complete the mosaic.",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al.

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

      "description": "FEMA Region 6 TX - Rio Grande and Fort Whitman Watershed QL2 LiDAR project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LIDAR data to be collected  at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter.  Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.  The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83, UTM Zone 13, Meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), Meters.  LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 6 individual 1500m x 1500m tiles for the pilot (995 individual 1500m x 1500m tiles), and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1500m x 1500m schema, and Breaklines in Esri shapefile format.Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in Fall 2014, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels.  In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Photo Science established a total of 30 QA calibration control points and 80 Land Cover control points that were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Rio Grande and Fort Whitman Watershed project area.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

Lidar data, and derivative products produced in compliance with this task order are part of the data to be obtained under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Contract number G10PC00025.Specifications listed below are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 13. USGS has a requirement for Lidar data over Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties in Texas. Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties is to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 2.0 meters. The Calhoun, Nueces, Willacy, Hidalgo Counties Texas Lidar Acquisition project is to provide high accuracy bare-earth processed Lidar data suitable for the project area.The project consisted of acquisition, post-processing, classification of Lidar data, and creation of final deliverable products. All areas shall be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 2.0 meters based on UTM14, related to the North American Datum of 1983 (NSRS2007). Vertical accuracy was to achieve a RMSE Z of 12.5 cm (95% confidence level of less than 24.5 cm) or better in the \"Open Terrain\" land cover category for all areas.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al.

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

      "description": "An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 6 meter horizontal RMSE for locations within the United States.Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum, spheroid GRS80. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to provide geographic reference for federal, state, and local emergency responders, as well as for homeland security efforts. Orthoimages also serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for earth science investigations and analysis. The digital orthoimage is useful as a layer of a geographic information system. These data can be used to provide reference information for web browsers and for map applications at a scale of 1:100:000 or smaller.",

The Northern AOI covered portions of the following counties in TX: Parker, Hood, Johnson, Ellis, Hill, Navarro, Henderson, McLennan, Limestone, Kaufmann, and Falls. The Central AOI covered portions of the following counties in TX: Guadalupe, Atascosa, Wilson, Gonzales, Karnes, DeWitt, Live Oak, and Bee. The Lidar collected was calibrated and processed to produce digital elevation model (DEM), Lidar intensity image, classified LAS point cloud, and hydro-breakline files for the geographic areas covered by the AOIs. The total area encompassed by this project was 4,542 square miles and was supplemented by the collection of a 300m buffer to ensure coverage.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The products acquired by this contract will be made available in the public domain through the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for use by government and the public.The purpose of this project was to collect and deliver high resolution topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for two areas of interest in TX. The elevation data will be used as base data for various types of modeling and analysisThis dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

      "description": "Provide high density Lidar elevation data map to establish an authoritative source for elevation information for the state of Texas. This Lidar operation was designed to provide a high density set of mass points within the defined areas.The data sets are suitable for the development of contours for use in hydraulic/hydrologic model development, and for assessing environmental impacts. Typical uses for the data set include: Flood Risk MAP (Mapping, Assessment, and Planning). DFIRM map updates. Watersheds and other hydro studies per FEMA specifications. County Mapping projects which include several uses, in addition to Flood mitigation assessment. Mapping projects that include accuracy verification, reporting and metadata.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4 points per square meter. The dates of acquisiton were from February 4, 2011 to March 5, 2011. A Leica ALS50 phase II+ and a Leica ALS60 Lidar sensor (Gonzales Block) were used collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas.

Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y).Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. The naming convention is based on the U. S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. Nominal Acquisition Altitude (AGL) was 9600'. The geoid used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights was Geoid 03. GPS coordinates are referenced to NAD83 Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 14. The maximum differential baseline length is 20.54 miles. The mean baseline length is 15.84 miles. Camera sensors calibration reports are included in the project report.

The original project AOI was defined by new quarter-quarter-quadrangle, NQQQ, tiles. The outside tiles were buffered by 300m on all sides and the interior tiles were buffered by 50m on all sides. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 1.0 meter.Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquisition acquired 101 flights lines in 13 lifts from March 15, 2009 through March 29, 2009. Lidar data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS50-II MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for Ft. Worth Region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract.

      "description": "This Lidar project is intended to provide high accuracy, classified multiple return Lidar, for approximately 139 square miles, of the City of Grand Prairie, Texas. The Lidar data was acquired and processed by Terrapoint USA to support hydrologic modeling and other engineering tasks. The product is a high density mass point dataset with an average point spacing of 0.7m. The data is tiled without a buffer, stored in LAS 1.0 format.The elevation data was verified internally prior to delivery to ensure it met fundamental accuracy requirements when compared kinematic to Terrapoint GPS checkpoints. The Lidar dataset for the City of Grand Prairie was tested 0.22ft vertical accuracy based on consolidated RMSE.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The DOQ is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).",

Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y).Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. The naming convention is based on the U. S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. Nominal Acquisition Altitude (AGL) was 9600'. The geoid used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights was Geoid 03. GPS coordinates are referenced to NAD83 Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 14. The maximum differential baseline length is 20.54 miles. The mean baseline length is 15.84 miles. Camera sensors calibration reports are included in the project report.

The SPOT satellites constellation offers acquisition and revisit capacity allowing to acquire imagery from anywhere in the world, every day.Each SPOT payload comprises two identical high resolution optical imaging instruments, which can operate simultaneously or individually in either panchromatic (P mode: a single wide band in the visible part of the spectrum) or multispectral mode (XS mode: the green, red, and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum).The orientation of each instrument's strip-selection mirror can be remotely steered by the ground stations, offering an oblique viewing capability up to angles of +/- 27 degrees from the satellite's vertical axis. In this way, the temporal resolution is shortened from 26 to 4-5 days for the temperate zones. On SPOT 5 , the HRS (High-Resolution Stereoscopic) imaging instrument also allows simultaneous acquisition of stereo pairs.",

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 305 flight lines in 36 lifts from December 18, 2013 to January 25, 2014. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 310 twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Riegl LMS-Q680i Lidar sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The classified Lidar point cloud data are delivered in LAS 1.2 format: 1, unclassified, 2, bare-earth ground, 3, low vegetation, 4, medium vegetation, 5, high vegetation, 6, buildings, 7, low points(noise), 9, water, 13, bridges, and 14, culverts. Specialized in-house and commercial software processes the native Lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The horizontal datum for the data is in UTM 14N Coordinates, NAD83(2011) in meters and the vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) in meters using GEIOD12A.The data acquired will become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset.

These are streams and waterbodies that have been individually defined by the TCEQ and assigned unique identification numbers. Intended to have relatively homogeneous chemical, physical, and hydrological characteristics, a segment provides a basic unit for assigning site-specific standards and for applying water quality management programs of the agency. Both \"classified\" and \"unclassified\" segments have been included in this layer. Classified segments, also referred to as designated segments, refer to water bodies that areprotected by site- specific criteria. The classified segments are listed and described in Appendix A and C of Chapter 307.10. The site-specific uses and criteria are described in Appendix A. Classified waters include most rivers and their major tributaries, major reservoirs, and estuaries. Unclassified waters are those smaller water bodies that do not have site-specific water quality standards assigned to them, but instead are protected by general standards that apply to all surface waters in the state. This layer also indentifies which assessment units have been assessed in the DRAFT 2010Texas Integrated Report for Clean Water Act Sections 305 (b) and 303 (d). An impaired assessment unit is a water body included in Category 5. Water bodies in Category 5 do not meet applicable water quality standards or are threatened for one or more designated uses by one or more pollutants.General purpose use; to support agency-wide policy decisions regarding surface water quality in the State of Texas.

The WBD is a seamless and consistent national Geographic Information System (GIS) database at a scale of 1:24,000, which has been extensively reviewed and matches to a minimum the USGS topographical 7.5 minute quadrangle map series. The traditional 8-digit hydrologic units (HUCs) have been further divided into smaller units called watersheds (10-digit HUCs) and sub-watersheds (12-digit HUCs). The watershed level is typically 40,000 to 250,000 acres, and the sub-watershed level is typically 10,000 to 40,000 acres with some as small as 3,000 acres. Federal Certification of the WBD for Texas was completed jointly by the NRCS and USGS in January 2009.This dataset, which has been developed to national standards (USGS and USDA/NRCS 2009), is intended to be managed in concert with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as part of the Stewardship Program, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey with partner Federal, State and Local entities. Continuing development of the WBD in Texas will be completion of the 10 and 12-digit delineations of coastal watersheds. Some of the low lying coastal HUCs were not completed due to a lack of ultra high resolution elevation data necessary to determine the watershed boundaries.",

NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The program was established to support FSA's strategic goals centered on agricultural production.This \"leaf-on\" orthoimagery is used for a wide variety of purposes throughout the state including land use planning, natural resource assessment and policy making . Projects are contracted each year based on available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Since 2008, NAIP statewide imagery have been acquired for Texas on a 2-year cycle.Since the NAIP for Texas began in 2004, vendors have used digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing the DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic per county. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.Technical Notes for 2016: The DOQQs were compressed by TNRIS into a lossless JPEG2000 format. Per FSA, full coverage along the TX/MX border is not available in some areas and some DOQQ tiles may contain black nodata areas along the TX/MX border.",

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

      "description": "The [Landscape Ecology Program](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/) at [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department] (http://tpwd.texas.gov/), in cooperation with private, state, and federal partners, has produced a new 398 class, 10 meter spatial resolution land classification map for Texas, known as the [Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/ems/). This was accomplished by attributing land cover and abiotic variables to 10 meter resolution image objects generated from NAIP photographs, and then executing expert rules in the form of: land cover + abiotic variables = mapped type.In some regions, enhanced satellite land cover classification, landform modeling efforts, or other ancillary data were included to map important current vegetation types. More than 14,000 ground data samples were collected in support of the mapping effort, the largest effort of this kind ever in Texas. Significant overall improvements over existing maps included better spatial and thematic resolution as well as the mapping of many live oak types statewide, evergreen versus deciduous shrublands in appropriate regions, a wide variety of disturbance types, and types over unique soils (e.g. salty, deep sand, gyp-influenced). The vegetation database resulted in an accuracy of 74% to 90%. These results are used by a wide variety of partners in Texas for conservation planning and management. Updates to the vegetation data may occur as funds are available in regions that are priorities for either TPWD or partners.The [Ecological Mapping Systems (EMS)](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/ems/) dataset is available for download online by ecoregion in vector, or statewide in raster format. The EMS dataset is also available through an user-friendly, interactive web app known as the [Texas Ecological Analytical Mapper (TEAM app)](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/team/). The TEAM app allows users to: view EMS data in relation to soils, hydrology, and ecoregion layers; print/export custom maps and reports of habitat data for custom areas/boundaries to PDF, KMZ, or Shapefiles; and calculate acres of vegetation types within an area of interest.",

The outside tiles were buffered by 300m on all sides and the interior tiles were buffered by 50m on all sides. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4pts /meter.Data was acquired by Terrapoint from May 20 through August 4th, 2010. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 375 aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS50-II MPiA sensor and a Cessna 210 aircraft, utilizing a Optech Sensor collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

      "description": "The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental United States. It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

The 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project under the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) was administered by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for 0.5-meter orthoimagery statewide with select areas additionally flown for 6-inch/1-foot orthoimagery.The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of TNRIS. Contributing partners to the statewide 0.5-meter orthoimagery were the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the Texas General Land Office (GLO), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), and the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC). Partners that increased pixel resolution from 0.5-meter to 6-inch/1-foot in select areas were the University Lands, the San Antonio River Authority, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and the City of Georgetown.All orthoimagery acquired under this project are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each 0.5-meter image tile covers one 4th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quad (DOQQ) or approximately 16 square miles with minimum 150-meter buffers.

Water quality permits are renewed approximately every five years. In order to maintain the most accurate set of locational data for water quality permits, the locational database is updated as wastewater permits are newly issued, outfalls change locations, and/or improved locational information becomes available.

In 1997, the legislature established a new water planning process, based on a “bottom-up,” consensus-driven approach. Coordinating this water planning process are 16 planning groups, one for each regional water planning area (see map). The planning groups, each made up of about 20 members, represent a variety of interests, including agriculture, industry, environment, public, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, groundwater management areas, and power generation. Each planning group approved bylaws to govern its methods of conducting business and designated a political subdivision, such as a river authority, groundwater conservation district, or council of governments, to administer the planning process and manage any contracts related to developing regional water plans. The planning groups conduct all functions during open meetings in an open and participatory manner. They hold special public meetings when they develop their scopes of work and hold hearings before adopting their regional water plans. This public involvement helps direct the planning and determine which water management strategies to recommend. Consensus building within the planning groups is crucial to ensure sufficient support for adopting the plan. Planning group members adopt plans by voting at open meetings in a",

The classified bare-earth data achieves the following: nominal horizontal spacing of 1.2 meters based on the Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 14, related to the North American Datum of 1983 (NSRS2007). Vertical accuracy was to achieve no more than 18.0 centimeters or better relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Accuracy statement is based on the area of moderate to flat terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas in dense vegetation.The accuracy of the Lidar data as tested met the vertical accuracy of 18.0 centimeters or less standards, however, derived products may be less accurate in areas of dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the bare-earth in these areas.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

These are streams and waterbodies that have been individually defined by the TCEQ and assigned unique identification numbers. Intended to have relatively homogeneous chemical, physical, and hydrological characteristics, a segment provides a basic unit for assigning site-specific standards and for applying water quality management programs of the agency. Both \"classified\" and \"unclassified\" segments have been included in this layer. Classified segments, also referred to as designated segments, refer to water bodies that areprotected by site- specific criteria.The classified segments are listed and described in Appendix A and C of Chapter 307.10. The site-specific uses and criteria are described in Appendix A. Classified waters include most rivers and their major tributaries, major reservoirs, and estuaries. Unclassified waters are those smaller water bodies that do not have site-specific water quality standards assigned to them, but instead are protected by general standards that apply to all surface waters in the state.This layer also indentifies which segments and water bodies have been assessed in the DRAFT 2010 Texas Integrated Report for Clean Water Act Sections 305 (b) and 303 (d). An impaired segment is a water body included in Category 5. Water bodies in Category 5 do not meet applicable water quality standards or are threatened for one or more designated uses by one or more pollutants. General purpose use; to support agency-wide policy decisions regarding surface water quality in the State of Texas.

      "description": "The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental United States. It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

      "description": "The project area is 840 tiles covering approximately 3300 square miles in the Austin / Waller counties of Texas. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 0.5 meter. The AeroMetric, Inc. acquisition covered 440 flights lines in 51 lifts from January 8, 2011 through February 3, 2011. Lidar data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo aircraft, utilizing an Optech Gemini sensor, Serial Number 07SEN201, collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Keystone Aerial Surveys was sub-contracted by AeroMetric, Inc. to complete a portion of the acquisition of this area. Keystone completed 26 of the 51 lifts, utilizing an Optech Gemini sensor, Serial Number 05SEN191, in a Cessna 310. the Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

For example, the Nueces-Rio Grande Coastal Basin is bounded on the north by the Nueces River Basin and on the south by the Rio Grande Basin. Each coastal basin is also bounded by a bay or other outlet to the Gulf of Mexico. The unique features of each of these basins are a function of many factors, but one of the most critical is precipitation, which varies from less than 10 inches per year in the western part of the state to more than 55 inches per year in the east.

The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4 points per square meter. The dates of acquisiton were from January 21, 2011 to April 1, 2011. A Leica ALS 50 phase II + Lidar sensor was used collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

      "description": "This data has been acquired and developed by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for collection and delivery of topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for the 50 sq. mile project area encompassing the planned Palo Pinto Mountains State Park. Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 21 flight lines in 2 lifts on December 17, 2013. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 310 twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Riegl LMS-Q680i Lidar sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The classified Lidar point cloud data are delivered in LAS 1.2 format: 1, unclassified, 2, bare-earth ground, 3, low vegetation, 4, medium vegetation, 5, high vegetation, 6, buildings, 7, low points(noise), 9, water, 13, bridges, and 14, culverts. Specialized in-house and commercial software processes the native Lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The horizontal datum for the data is UTM Coordinates, NAD83(2011) in meters and the vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) in meters using GEIOD12A.The data acquired will become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The project consists of high accuracy classified Lidar data in LAS format as well as raster digital elevation models and intensity images.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression.

The area is part of the 2014/2015 Statewide Orthoimagery Project under the Texas Orthoimagery Program (TOP) administered by the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) for 0.5-meter orthoimagery statewide. The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of TNRIS. The University Lands was a contributing partner to BUY-UP or increase pixel resolution for the West TX area from 0.5-meter to 6-inch. The orthoimagery are 4-band (R,G,B,NIR), natural color and color infrared capable. Each image tile covers one 64th of a USGS Digital Orthophoto Quad (DOQ) resulting in a DO4Q or approximately 1 square mile with minimum 300-foot buffers.Orthoimagery datasets are valuable mapping assets benefitting natural resources, energy, environmental, emergency management, land use planning, economic development, and policy interests. The aerial imagery was acquired from aircraft with digital camera sensors and processed as highly accurate digital orthoimagery that are used to identify current conditions, features, and changes on the ground serving as a base reference for other map information.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.",

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This \"leaf-on\" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.",

All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by this rectangular system of surveys, which is regulated by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The PLSS typically divides land into 6-mile-square townships, which is the level of information included in the National Atlas. Townships are subdivided into 36 one-mile- square sections. Sections can be further subdivided into quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections, or irregular government lots.Normally, a permanent monument, or marker, is placed at each section corner. Monuments are also placed at quarter-section corners and at other important points, such as the corners of government lots. Today permanent monuments are usually inscribed tablets set on iron rods or in concrete. The original PLSS surveys were often marked by wooden stakes or posts, marked trees, pits, or piles of rock, or other less-permanent markers.",

      "description": "Topographic mapping of eleven small project sites mapped throughout Central and Eastern Texas in April of 2012. Site A consisted of a total of 40 individual tiles. The product covered by this metadata file consists of classified Lidar point clouds in .LAS format, collected with a Trimble Harrier 68i Lidar sensor by SAM, Inc.The purpose of this Lidar data is to become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain. The data will also be used by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Dam Safety staff in the performance of hydraulic modeling to determine potential areas of inundation downstream of dam structures for inclusion in Emergency Action Plans and to more accurately assess the downstream hazard rating.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.- Software with native LAZ support- ERDAS IMAGINE (14.1 and up) by Hexagon Geospatial- Global Mapper (13.1 and up) by Blue Marble Geo- ENVI LiDAR (5.1 and up) by Exelis VIS- FME (2012 and up) by Safe Software- LAStools by rapidlasso- plas.io 3D Web Viewer by Hobu Inc.- FUSION (3.40 and up) by Bob McGaughey of the USDA- Voyager (1.3 and up) by Voyager GIS- GRASS GIS (7.0 and up) by Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)",
