## API and content management system for TNRIS data!
* Check out the wiki to learn about the data model and other curiosities

## Setup
Built with:
* Python 3.6 ([virtual environment](https://howchoo.com/g/nwewzjmzmjc/a-guide-to-python-virtual-environments-with-virtualenvwrapper) suggested)
* PostgreSQL 10.3
  * Amazon RDS Instance
* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/install/)
* For data scripts, you probably want to use some form of python virtual env manager to maintain an isolated environment. A good run-down of the options can be found in [The Hitchiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). A recommended setup is virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper. [Anaconda](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/) is an alternative but it has not been successfully tested.

1. Enable your virtual environment. Example: `workon data.tnris.org` (for virtualenv wrapper)
2. Upgrade pip using `pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Install python dependencies:
   * `cd ~/data.tnris.org/src`
   * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You will need to use your configured AWS CLI when working locally to manage the django static files. If not already set up, you will need to install the AWS CLI and configure it with an access key and secret key.

## Develop

  1. Set up a local development db instance or use [local port forwarding](https://blog.trackets.com/2014/05/17/ssh-tunnel-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-explained-with-examples.html) to connect to a remote db instance
  1. `cd ~/data.tnris.org/src/data-hub`
  1. Configure ~/data.tnris.org/src/data-hub/dev_settings.py to point at your dev db
  1. run `python manage.py runserver --settings=data-hub.dev_settings` to run the app locally, it will be available at `localhost:8000`

## Deployment Prep

### Note: A deployment for this app has yet to be created

1. Make sure `DEBUG = False` in ~/data.tnris.org/src/data-hub/settings.py
1. `cd ~/data.tnris.org/src/data-hub`
1. run `python manage.py collectstatic` to compile all static files
1. `cd ~/data.tnris.org/src`
1. `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to save dependencies
1. head over to the deployments repo to execute the actual application deployment and make it so
