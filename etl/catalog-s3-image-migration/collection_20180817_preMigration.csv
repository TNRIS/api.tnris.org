It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This ""leaf-on"" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.","USDA",t,t,"Only color balanced with 3 of 4 bands","data-catalog/entry/national-agriculture-imagery-program-naip-2010-1m-nc-cir.md","https://webservices.tnris.org/arcgis/services/NAIP/NAIP10_NC_CIR_1m/ImageServer/WMSServer","https://webservices.tnris.org/arcgis/rest/services/NAIP/NAIP10_NC_CIR_1m/ImageServer?f=jsapi","d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911","images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2010_1m_nc_cir_overview.jpg","images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2010_1m_nc_cir_th.jpg","images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2010_1m_nc_cir_natural.jpg","images/data-catalog/entry/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2010_1m_nc_cir_urban.jpg","https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/datacatalog/tile_index/national_agriculture_imagery_program_naip_2010_1m_nc_cir_tileindex.zip","","","Texas","Texas, Statewide, National Agricultural Imagery Program, NAIP, United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, Natural Color, NC, Infrared, CIR, Mosaic, Orthoimagery, Aerial, Historical","2018-07-30 11:42:39.923+00","2018-08-07 20:51:01.357923+00","77e1eb26-96d8-4415-bf70-a29d7f679ca9","593a35c8-9527-4e32-a3bf-c59c56173dd9","40d5e189-a34c-40f3-aa24-632bf1fab596"

The project AOI was defined by new quarter-quarter-quadrangle, NQQQ, tiles. The outside tiles were buffered by 300m on all sides and the interior tiles were buffered by 50m on all sides. The project design of the Lidar data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 4pts /meter.Data was acquired by Surdex Inc. and The Atlantic Group under sub-contract to Surdex from May 20 through August 4th , 2010. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 375 aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS50-II MPiA sensor and a Cessna 210 aircraft, utilizing a Optech Sensor collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

The Statement of Work was issued by the Strategic Mapping Program (StratMap) of the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), part of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The project area is approximately 6,570 square miles in Bastrop, Bexar, Caldwell, Colorado, Comal, Fayette, Guadalupe, Hays, Travis, and Williamson County, Texas. The data were acquired by Fugro with third party QAQC from AECOM. The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition were December 15, 2016-March 24, 2017. The purpose of this lidar data project was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled lidar in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

All lands in the public domain are subject to subdivision by this rectangular system of surveys, which is regulated by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The PLSS typically divides land into 6-mile-square townships, which is the level of information included in the National Atlas. Townships are subdivided into 36 one-mile- square sections. Sections can be further subdivided into quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections, or irregular government lots.Normally, a permanent monument, or marker, is placed at each section corner.

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This ""leaf-on"" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.

The project area is approximately 286 square miles in Brazos County, Texas. The data was acquired by Dewberry with third party QAQC from Surveying and Mapping, LLC. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition are February 9-10, 2015. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

This Imagery project was handled predominately by the TNRIS Internship program. This project created the opportunity for Interns to learn important and valuable skills relating to the GIS industry. In addition to professional practices, interns were trained in several industry software applications. This product afforded the interns the opportunity to produce an important dataset that is distributed to the public.Images were scanned at 800 dpi to create a 1 meter resolution dataset. ERDAS AutoSync was used to reference the historical imagery to the TOP 1995/1996 Orthoimagery dataset. The CIAP imagery is the most accurate historical imagery product that TNRIS has produced. The details on each frame’s accuracy and statistics are included in metadata for each frame.Mosaics were created in the Mosaic Pro toolset of ERDAS. The mosaics are black and white, 1 meter resolution datasets of each of the collections. Referenced images were edgematched prior to mosaicking to ensure a seamless product.

Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 305 flight lines in 36 lifts from December 18, 2013 to January 25, 2014. Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 310 twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Riegl LMS-Q680i Lidar sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The classified Lidar point cloud data are delivered in LAS 1.2 format: 1, unclassified, 2, bare-earth ground, 3, low vegetation, 4, medium vegetation, 5, high vegetation, 6, buildings, 7, low points(noise), 9, water, 13, bridges, and 14, culverts. Specialized in-house and commercial software processes the native Lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The horizontal datum for the data is in UTM 14N Coordinates, NAD83(2011) in meters and the vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) in meters using GEIOD12A.The data acquired will become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The project consists of high accuracy classified Lidar data in LAS format as well as raster digital elevation models and intensity images.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality.

Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.

Federal Certification of the WBD for Texas was completed jointly by the NRCS and USGS in January 2009.This dataset, which has been developed to national standards (USGS and USDA/NRCS 2009), is intended to be managed in concert with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) as part of the Stewardship Program, supported by the U.S. Geological Survey with partner Federal, State and Local entities. Continuing development of the WBD in Texas will be completion of the 10 and 12-digit delineations of coastal watersheds. Some of the low lying coastal HUCs were not completed due to a lack of ultra high resolution elevation data necessary to determine the watershed boundaries.","USGS",t,t,"Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect","data-catalog/entry/watershed-boundaries.md","","","d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911","images/data-catalog/entry/watershed_boundaries_overview.jpg","images/data-catalog/entry/watershed_boundaries_th.jpg","","","","","","Texas","Texas, Statewide, Watershed, Hydrography, Hydrology, HUC, Boundaries, USGS, United States Geological Survey","2018-07-30 11:42:39.942+00","2018-07-30 11:42:39.942+00","","593a35c8-9527-4e32-a3bf-c59c56173dd9","40d5e189-a34c-40f3-aa24-632bf1fab596"

Projects are contracted each year based on available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Since 2008, NAIP statewide imagery have been acquired for Texas on a 2-year cycle.Since the NAIP for Texas began in 2004, vendors have used digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing the DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic per county. All individual tile images and the resulting mosaic are rectified in the UTM coordinate system, NAD 83, and cast into a single predetermined UTM zone.Technical Notes for 2016: The DOQQs were compressed by TNRIS into a lossless JPEG2000 format.

This dataset was developed from aerial imagery, 14,000+ ground control points, and modeling various abiotic variables such as, slope, elevation, and soils.</p>","The [Landscape Ecology Program](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/) at [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department] (http://tpwd.texas.gov/), in cooperation with private, state, and federal partners, has produced a new 398 class, 10 meter spatial resolution land classification map for Texas, known as the [Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/ems/). This was accomplished by attributing land cover and abiotic variables to 10 meter resolution image objects generated from NAIP photographs, and then executing expert rules in the form of: land cover + abiotic variables = mapped type.In some regions, enhanced satellite land cover classification, landform modeling efforts, or other ancillary data were included to map important current vegetation types. More than 14,000 ground data samples were collected in support of the mapping effort, the largest effort of this kind ever in Texas. Significant overall improvements over existing maps included better spatial and thematic resolution as well as the mapping of many live oak types statewide, evergreen versus deciduous shrublands in appropriate regions, a wide variety of disturbance types, and types over unique soils (e.g. salty, deep sand, gyp-influenced). The vegetation database resulted in an accuracy of 74% to 90%. These results are used by a wide variety of partners in Texas for conservation planning and management. Updates to the vegetation data may occur as funds are available in regions that are priorities for either TPWD or partners.The [Ecological Mapping Systems (EMS)](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/ems/) dataset is available for download online by ecoregion in vector, or statewide in raster format. The EMS dataset is also available through an user-friendly, interactive web app known as the [Texas Ecological Analytical Mapper (TEAM app)](http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/land/programs/landscape-ecology/team/). The TEAM app allows users to: view EMS data in relation to soils, hydrology, and ecoregion layers; print/export custom maps and reports of habitat data for custom areas/boundaries to PDF, KMZ, or Shapefiles; and calculate acres of vegetation types within an area of interest.","TPWD",t,t,"Vectorized from Raster images, stair step effect","data-catalog/entry/tpwd-texas-ecological-systems-data.md","","","d5084e86-dec9-11e4-afda-0e0c41326911","images/data-catalog/entry/tpwd_texas_ecological_systems_data_overview.jpg","images/data-catalog/entry/tpwd_texas_ecological_systems_data_th.jpg","","","","","","Texas","Vegetation, Communities, Land Use, Texas, Statewide, TPWD, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department","2018-07-30 11:42:39.936+00","2018-07-30 11:42:39.936+00","70817c70-7364-45a8-971a-00908a95a111","","40d5e189-a34c-40f3-aa24-632bf1fab596"

The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This ""leaf-on"" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.

In 1997, the legislature established a new water planning process, based on a “bottom-up,” consensus-driven approach. Coordinating this water planning process are 16 planning groups, one for each regional water planning area (see map). The planning groups, each made up of about 20 members, represent a variety of interests, including agriculture, industry, environment, public, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, groundwater management areas, and power generation. Each planning group approved bylaws to govern its methods of conducting business and designated a political subdivision, such as a river authority, groundwater conservation district, or council of governments, to administer the planning process and manage any contracts related to developing regional water plans. The planning groups conduct all functions during open meetings in an open and participatory manner. They hold special public meetings when they develop their scopes of work and hold hearings before adopting their regional water plans. This public involvement helps direct the planning and determine which water management strategies to recommend. Consensus building within the planning groups is crucial to ensure sufficient support for adopting the plan.

The classified bare-earth data achieves the following: nominal horizontal spacing of 1.2 meters based on the Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 14, related to the North American Datum of 1983 (NSRS2007). Vertical accuracy was to achieve no more than 18.0 centimeters or better relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Accuracy statement is based on the area of moderate to flat terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas in dense vegetation.The accuracy of the Lidar data as tested met the vertical accuracy of 18.0 centimeters or less standards, however, derived products may be less accurate in areas of dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the bare-earth in these areas.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

Lidar data collection was performed with a Cessna 310 twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Riegl LMS-Q680i Lidar sensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The classified Lidar point cloud data are delivered in LAS 1.2 format: 1, unclassified, 2, bare-earth ground, 3, low vegetation, 4, medium vegetation, 5, high vegetation, 6, buildings, 7, low points(noise), 9, water, 13, bridges, and 14, culverts. Specialized in-house and commercial software processes the native Lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The horizontal datum for the data is UTM Coordinates, NAD83(2011) in meters and the vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) in meters using GEIOD12A.The data acquired will become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain.The data are intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset.

Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.

NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.

Sections can be further subdivided into quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections, or irregular government lots.Normally, a permanent monument, or marker, is placed at each section corner. Monuments are also placed at quarter-section corners and at other important points, such as the corners of government lots.

Site A consisted of a total of 40 individual tiles. The product covered by this metadata file consists of classified Lidar point clouds in .LAS format, collected with a Trimble Harrier 68i Lidar sensor by SAM, Inc.The purpose of this Lidar data is to become part of an ongoing data collection by the State of Texas to support mapping and modeling of flood plains, hydrography, and terrain. The data will also be used by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Dam Safety staff in the performance of hydraulic modeling to determine potential areas of inundation downstream of dam structures for inclusion in Emergency Action Plans and to more accurately assess the downstream hazard rating.This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression. LASTools provides a lossless compression of the data from las to laz formats.- Software with native LAZ support- ERDAS IMAGINE (14.1 and up) by Hexagon Geospatial- Global Mapper (13.1 and up) by Blue Marble Geo- ENVI LiDAR (5.1 and up) by Exelis VIS- FME (2012 and up) by Safe Software- LAStools by rapidlasso- plas.io 3D Web Viewer by Hobu Inc.- FUSION (3.40 and up) by Bob McGaughey of the USDA- Voyager (1.3 and up) by Voyager GIS- GRASS GIS (7.0 and up) by Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)","TNRIS",t,t,"None","data-catalog/entry/stratmap-2012-50cm-tceq-dam-safety-sites.md","","","6c812f96-e2c4-11e4-b38f-0e0c41326911","images/data-catalog/entry/stratmap_2012_50cm_tceq_dam_safety_sites_overview.jpg","images/data-catalog/entry/stratmap_2012_50cm_tceq_dam_safety_sites_th.jpg","","","https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/d/tnris-lidar/state/tx/tnris-lidar_tx.zip","https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/datacatalog/supplemental_reports/stratmap_2012_50cm_tceq_dam_safety_sites_supplementalreports.zip","https://tnris-datadownload.s3.amazonaws.com/datacatalog/lidar_breaklines/stratmap_2012_50cm_tceq_dam_safety_sites_breaklines.zip","Small Portions of Marion, Harrison, Smith, Henderson, Anderson, Ellis, Hood, Johnson, Callahan, Bandera","Marion, Harrison, Smith, Henderson, Anderson, Ellis, Hood, Johnson, Callahan, Bandera, Lidar, Point Cloud, LAS, Elevation, County, Historical","2018-07-30 11:42:39.932+00","2018-07-30 11:42:39.932+00","","593a35c8-9527-4e32-a3bf-c59c56173dd9","40d5e189-a34c-40f3-aa24-632bf1fab596"
