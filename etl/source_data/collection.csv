Lidar data was collected for this project, encompassing four distinct Areas of Interest (AOIs) within the State of Texas. These AOIs have been designated as AOI 1 through AOI 4. AOI1 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Rains, Wood, Upshur, Van Zandt, Smith, Gregg, Henderson and Cherokee. The AOI 2 is within Dallas County. AOI 3 covers portions of Ellis and Kaufman Counties. The remaining AOI 4 covers portions of the following counties in TX: Navarro, Henderson, Freestone and Anderson. The Lidar was calibrated and processed to produce digital elevation model (DEM), Lidar intensity image, classified LAS point cloud, and hydro-breakline files for the areas covered by the AOIs. The data is intended to exceed requirements for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) specifications for Floodplain Mapping as well as serve as an input to the U.S. Geological Survey refinements to the National Elevation Dataset. The products acquired by this contract are to be made available in the public domain through the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS) for use by government and the public. The project team includes Atkins North America, Inc., Williams Aerial and Mapping (WAM), and McKim; Creed. Fugro Geospatial Inc. conducted an independent QA/QC of the project deliverables for TNRIS. Project stakeholders include the Texas Natural Resources Information System (TNRIS), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the City of Tyler (COT), the Trinity River Authority (TRA), and the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD).This dataset was acquired through the High Priority Imagery and Data Sets (HPIDS) contract. The contract was created in 2009 to maximize spending power by coordinating geospatial data purchases to share costs and to ensure that acquired data meet high standards of quality. The successor to HPIDS is the StratMap contract, established in 2015.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression.

Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009.Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition. NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.

This was accomplished by attributing land cover and abiotic variables to 10 meter resolution image objects generated from NAIP photographs, and then executing expert rules in the form of: land cover + abiotic variables = mapped type.In some regions, enhanced satellite land cover classification, landform modeling efforts, or other ancillary data were included to map important current vegetation types. More than 14,000 ground data samples were collected in support of the mapping effort, the largest effort of this kind ever in Texas. Significant overall improvements over existing maps included better spatial and thematic resolution as well as the mapping of many live oak types statewide, evergreen versus deciduous shrublands in appropriate regions, a wide variety of disturbance types, and types over unique soils (e.g. salty, deep sand, gyp-influenced). The vegetation database resulted in an accuracy of 74% to 90%. These results are used by a wide variety of partners in Texas for conservation planning and management.

In 1997, the legislature established a new water planning process, based on a “bottom-up,” consensus-driven approach. Coordinating this water planning process are 16 planning groups, one for each regional water planning area (see map). The planning groups, each made up of about 20 members, represent a variety of interests, including agriculture, industry, environment, public, municipalities, business, water districts, river authorities, water utilities, counties, groundwater management areas, and power generation. Each planning group approved bylaws to govern its methods of conducting business and designated a political subdivision, such as a river authority, groundwater conservation district, or council of governments, to administer the planning process and manage any contracts related to developing regional water plans. The planning groups conduct all functions during open meetings in an open and participatory manner. They hold special public meetings when they develop their scopes of work and hold hearings before adopting their regional water plans.

A Leica ALS50 phase II+ and a Leica ALS60 Lidar sensor (Gonzales Block) were used collecting multiple return x, y, and z data as well as intensity data. Lidar data was processed to achieve a bare ground surface.Lidar data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. Using a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning and inertial measurement technologies, Lidar instruments are able to make highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earths terrain, man-made structures and vegetation.The purpose of this project is to collect and deliver topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements for north region in Texas. The elevation data will be used as base data for Texas flood plain mapping.Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/).

The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This ""leaf-on"" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.

The data was acquired by Fugro with third party QAQC from AECOM. The project specification for the lidar data acquisition was developed to support a point density of 4 points per square meter, The dates of acquisition are December 29, 2016-March 22, 2017. The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.4 format, 3D breaklines, and 1 meter cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).Lidar data for Texas is made available online through the use of data compression using [LASTools](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/). LASTools is an open-source collection of tools for lidar data viewing and manipulation. TNRIS uses the LASzip portion of LASTools for compression\decompression.

It is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) in Salt Lake City. The primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.This ""leaf-on"" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to digital sensors in imagery acquisition.NAIP imagery products are available either as digital ortho quarter quad tiles (DOQQs) or as compressed county mosaics (CCM). The area for DOQQs corresponds to the USGS topographic quadrangles. Each image tile covers a 3.75 x 3.75 minute quarter quadrangle plus a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. CCMs are generated by compressing DOQQ image tiles into a single mosaic.
