The vast majority of Apps have one thing in common - Location. In this course, we will review how the Web Map is the core tool that allows you to create, configure, deploy, and share Off-the-Shelf, Location-based Apps. Attendees will learn how to build and share configurable Apps, how to deploy focused Apps using Web AppBuilder and how to create meaningful Story Maps.

Goals: Create, configure, and share a Web Map, learn about the variety of Solutions available in ArcGIS Online, Select, create, configure, and share a Configurable, Off-the-Shelf App, Learn how to build an App using Web AppBuilder, Configure and deploy an Operations Dashboard, and how to create and share a meaningful Story Map.","","2019-07-17 19:13:18.727149+00","2019-07-17 19:13:18.727189+00",True

In the age of data science, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, GIS “software as usual” approaches are due for an upgrade, and lower cost choices are emerging. Whether you are looking for a GIS tune-up or an enterprise GIS overhaul, Open Source options are mature enough to be strongly considered. This workshop will explain and demonstrate Open Source potential from three key perspectives that can help you start, or continue, your adoption path: (1) the Open Source ecosystem - why it exists and how it operates to your benefit; (2) Open Source technologies - what’s out there, advantages and disadvantages, and how OS can enhance existing enterprise GIS; and (3) the Open Source adoption path - how to get started, how to build internal support and show results, and how OS can help drive organizational change. The workshop will include real world case studies that can be adapted to your situation. It will draw from the AppGeo team’s direct and substantial experience with a variety of Open Source geospatial IT technologies and platforms, and bring to Texas what we learn from organizing, co-chairing, and participating in the 2017 International Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) conference that is taking place in Boston this August.","If you’ve ever wondered about or experimented with Open Source technology for your GIS operation, this workshop is for you.","2019-07-17 20:11:25.843137+00","2019-07-17 20:11:25.843178+00",True

The new ArcGIS Earth product from Esri has many of the same Google Earth like functions plus a lot of the features you’ve used with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Desktop. ArcGIS Earth lets you explore the world in 3D and 2D formats and load your own data from various sources including KML, shapefiles, CSV files, ArcGIS Server, and ArcGIS Online. These data sources can be draped across the terrain for realistic 3D visualizations. You can also add various pre-created basemaps from ArcGIS Online. 

In addition to displaying data in these formats you can also create sketches including points, lines, and polygons and add labels to these features. You can also measure features in 3D, search for addresses and known locations, print maps, and email views. Touch navigation is also possible if you have a touch screen Windows device. Rather than using mouse for navigation you can just use your fingers to zoom in and out, pan, rotate the view, and adjust the camera angle. And this is all in version 1.0 of ArcGIS Earth. In future releases you can expect to see additional functionality including map tours, offline use, timesliders, support for WMS, and much more! In this half day class you’ll learn how to put ArcGIS Earth as a new tool in your GIS toolbox.
